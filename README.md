The current codes are used for duplicating the results reported in the manuscript

2021-04-09

I modified the DNILMF diffusion based scripts in the cv calculation for better/fair comparison. Note the modified scipt may give the results lower than the original one for DNILMF

How to run:

- First download the benchmark dataset at (http://web.kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp/supp/yoshi/drugtarget/) and put them into individual folder

- Go into individual folder

- Run source("demo_sth.R") file to get the result
